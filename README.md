## Workshop Overview

The EKS Goat: AWS ECR & EKS Security Masterclass - From Exploitation to Defense is an immersive workshop designed to take participants through real-world scenarios of attacking and defending Kubernetes clusters hosted on AWS EKS.

This workshop provides a comprehensive approach, from understanding the anatomy of attacks on EKS clusters using AWS ECR to deploying robust defense mechanisms. Participants will learn how to backdoor AWS ECR image & exploit misconfigurations and vulnerabilities within AWS EKS, followed by the implementation of best security practices to safeguard the environment.

- Key Takeaways:
  - Hands-on labs focused on exploiting EKS misconfigurations.
  - Techniques for lateral movement, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation using AWS ECR in AWS EKS .
